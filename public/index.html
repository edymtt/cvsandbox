<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I'm a computer enthusiast for 12 years and a programmer with 3 and a half years of experience.</p>

<p>I strive to continually improve the quality of my code and to apply best practices in my daily work. In this sense actually I'm interested in craftsmanship, clean code, verification/validation, unit testing, continuous integration and rewriting of legacy code.</p>

<p>I'm well versed in exploring/assessing new technologies to understand their characteristics and the problems they pose in their adoption. Moreover I'm up to date on the latest news and trends on programming and IT.</p>

<p>I aspire to work as a Software Engineer or Software Engineer in Test (or equivalent roles), possibly on operating systems, compilers, developer tools or real-time/embedded systems.</p>
